## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project, i learned how to put the container in the middle of the page, using properly the margin and flexbox.

This was my favorite code that i wrote:

```css
.conteiner {
    width: 320px;
    height: 500px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: var(--main-white);
    margin-top: 50px;
    box-shadow: 1px 1px 5px gray;
}
```


### Continued development

By the time, i want to improve my flexbox and grid skills, i think they're the one of the most important skill to have in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Resource](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/152915/centralizar-div) - This helped me to understand how to put the div in the middle of the page. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
